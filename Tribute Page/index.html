            <h2>Why I Admire Nelson Mandela</h2>
            <p>Nelson Mandela’s relentless pursuit of justice and equality is a source of inspiration for many. He spent 27 years in prison for his opposition to the apartheid regime, and when released, he chose reconciliation over revenge. Mandela's ability to forgive and work toward a peaceful future for South Africa is a profound example of leadership and humanity.</p>
            <p>Mandela's words continue to inspire us today: "It always seems impossible until it's done." His actions taught the world that real change comes from resilience, courage, and an unwavering commitment to fairness and dignity for all.</p>
