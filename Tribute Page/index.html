            <blockquote>"I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended"</blockquote>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Nelson Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezo, South Africa, became a global symbol of the fight against apartheid, the oppressive system of racial segregation in South Africa. After joining the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944, Mandela advocated for peaceful resistance but later helped form the ANC’s militant wing. In 1962, he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison for his activism, spending 27 years incarcerated, most of it on Robben Island. During his imprisonment, Mandela became the face of the anti-apartheid movement worldwide.

                Released in 1990, Mandela led the negotiations that ended apartheid and, in 1994, became South Africa’s first black president. Instead of seeking revenge, he promoted reconciliation, working to heal the deeply divided nation. Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and, after serving one term, continued his work through the Nelson Mandela Foundation. He passed away on December 5, 2013, leaving a lasting legacy of justice, equality, and forgiveness.</p>
